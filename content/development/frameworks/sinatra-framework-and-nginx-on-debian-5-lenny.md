Sinatra is a simple lightweight framework for web application development in the Ruby programming language. Rather than providing a complete development system, Sinatra provides a basic URL-mapping system that developers can use to create powerful custom applications.

Set the Hostname
----------------

Before you begin installing and configuring the components described in this guide, please make sure you've followed our instructions for [setting your hostname](/docs/getting-started#sph_set-the-hostname). Issue the following commands to make sure it is set properly:

    hostname
    hostname -f

The first command should show your short hostname, and the second should show your fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

Install Software
----------------

To install a more current version of Ruby Gems, which is required for running Sinatra Applications on Debian 5 (Lenny), you must install several packages from the [Backports project](http://backports.debian.org). Insert the following line in your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file:

{{< file-excerpt "/etc/apt/sources.list" >}}
deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports lenny-backports main

{{< /file-excerpt >}}


Issue the following commands to update your system's package database and all installed packages, and install the backports repository's key:

    apt-get update 
    apt-get upgrade
    apt-get install debian-backports-keyring

Add the following snippet to the `/etc/apt/preferences` file (you may need to create it):

{{< file-excerpt "/etc/apt/preferences" nginx >}}
# [...]
http {
    include /srv/www/example.com/nginx.conf; 
    passenger_root /opt/passenger-3.0.1;
    passenger_ruby /usr/bin/ruby1.8;
# [...]

{{< /file-excerpt >}}


This inserts the contents of `/srv/www/example.com/nginx.conf` into your nginx configuration, and allows you to specify the configuration of the virtual host for the `example.com` site. Consider the following example configuration, and modify this file to meet the needs of your deployment:

{{< file "/srv/www/example.com/nginx.conf" nginx >}}
server {
        listen 80;
        server_name www.example.com example.com;

    access_log /srv/www/example.com/logs/access.log;
        error_log /srv/www/example.com/logs/error.log;

        root /srv/www/example.com/application/public;
        passenger_enabled on;

    location /static {
            root   /srv/www/example.com/public;
            index  index.html index.htm index.php;
        }

}

{{< /file >}}


Your Sinatra application will handle all requests for the `www.example.com` and `example.com` domains, except those that begin with `/static` which are handled directly by nginx. When this configuration has been created and properly modified, issue the following command to restart the web server:

    /etc/init.d/nginx restart

Create a Basic Sinatra Application
----------------------------------

The following is a very basic Sinatra application. Place the following code in the `/srv/www/example.com/application/app.rb` file.

{{< file "/srv/www/example.com/application/app.rb" ruby >}}
require 'rubygems'
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  "Hello and Goodbye"
end

get '/hi' do
  "Hello World! :)"
end

get '/bye' do
  "Goodbye World! :("
end

{{< /file >}}


Deploy Sinatra Applications with Rack
-------------------------------------

Create a Rack configuration file located at `/srv/www/example.com/application/config.ru` to allow Passenger to run your application properly. Deploy the following `config.ru` file:

{{< file "/srv/www/example.com/application/config.ru" ruby >}}
require 'rubygems'
require 'sinatra'

require 'app'
run Sinatra::Application

{{< /file >}}


The `require 'app'` statement references the `app.rb` file. Modify this line to `require` your application. Any time you make changes to your Rack file or your application, issue the following command so that Passenger will restart your application:

    touch /srv/www/example.com/application/tmp/restart.txt

You can now access your Sinatra application by visiting `http://example.com/`in your web browser. If you used the example application above, visit "`http://example.com/`, `http://example.com/hi`, and `http://example.com/bye` to view different messages.
